httpreq
=======

httpreq is a javascript library for sending an asynchronous http request with
help of XMLHttpRequest. The goal of this project is a simple and configurable
library for ajax.

Using
=====

To do a request you must call httpreq() with request parameters as it first
argument. E.g.:

  httpreq({uri: "/get_data",
           resptype: "json",
           ok_rex: /2\d\d/,
           timeout: 6000,
           cb: {onok: req_ok,
                onnotok: req_notok,
                onfail: req_onfail.bind(this, "get_data req fail: ")}});

This call is doing a request to /get_data relative uri and wait a return
data in json format which is placed in first argument of req_ok() callback
function. If request is not success(a server respond with a status code not
satisfied ok_rex regexp), then req_notok() callback function is called with
an Error object instance as it first argument. If request is fail(a request is
not reached a server due to client-side abort or error or a response is not
arrived at specified timeout), then req_onfail() callback function is called
with an Error ojbect instance as it first argument.

All available parameters and it default values can be seen in httpreq.p
object. A short parameters description: 

method
  http method ("GET", "POST", etc)
uri
  destination uri
is_async
  is request asynchronous or not(true/false)
user
  for http basic authentication
password
  for http basic authentication
headers
  object with http headers name/value pairs
enctype
  encoding type for request(supported types can be found at the source bottom)
data
  object with request data
  For GET, HEAD and DELETE methods data is placed in uri in
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding; for other methods(e.g. PUT and
  POST) data is placed in payload according to specified enctype.
resptype
  a format of a response data that onok callback waits for
  Accept any values that XMLHttpRequest is supported("text", "json", "document",
  etc).
timeout
  a milliseconds quantity during which a response must be received
ok_rex
  regexp to classify a response status code as successful
cb.u.*
  upload callbacks(supported by XMLHttpRequest)
  If you need fine control or progress indicator or something else.
  All callbacks get an Event object as first argument and this is equal
  to httpreq.o object.
  If onabort/onerror/ontimeout callback is specified, then onfail callback
  isn't called for this event.
cb.d.*
  download callbacks(supported by XMLHttpRequest)
  If you need fine control or progress indicator or something else.
  All callbacks get an Event object as first argument and this is equal
  to httpreq.o object.
  If onabort/onerror/ontimeout callback is specified, then onfail callback
  isn't called for this event.
cb.onok
  a callback for successful response
  This callback is called if a response is received and response status code
  is satisfied ok_rex regexp.
  The callback get data in specified resptype format as first argument.
cb.onnotok
  a callback for unsuccessful response
  This callback is called if a response is received and response status code
  is not satisfied ok_rex regexp.
  The callback get Error object as first argument.
cb.onfail
  a callback for request fail
  This callback is called if a request is failed(due to client-side abort or
  error; or timeout)
  The callback get Error object as first argument.
debug
  debug level(now support only 2 values: 0 or 1)
  Log to console a debug info about request stage and progress.

If some values aren't specified in httpreq() call, httpreq use default values
from httpreq.p object. So, we can omit ok_rex parameter from previous example:

  httpreq({uri: "/get_data",
           resptype: "json",
           timeout: 6000,
           cb: {onok: req_ok,
                onnotok: req_notok,
                onfail: req_onfail.bind(this, "get_data req fail: ")}});

Moreover, we can set default value for timeout and for resptype(if our
application always wait a json format):

  httpreq.p.timeout = 6000;
  httpreq.p.resptype = "json";

  httpreq({uri: "/get_data",
           cb: {onok: req_ok,
                onnotok: req_notok,
                onfail: req_onfail.bind(this, "get_data req fail: ")}});

Now, our httpreq() call has parameters specific only for current request.

Also, some error messages can be modified - look at httpreq.err_msg object.

For other info see examples and the source file.
